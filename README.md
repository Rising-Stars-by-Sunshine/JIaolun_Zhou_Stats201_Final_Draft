This research aims to explore the use of advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to predict and manage diabetes. The study utilizes the well-known load diabetes dataset from scikit-learn and applies various statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to uncover key features and relationships between them. The findings suggest that certain features such as age, sex, BMI, and blood pressure are important indicators of diabetes risk, while others such as S1-S6 have less impact on the disease progression. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of XGBoost algorithm in predicting diabetes, although it requires extensive parameter tuning and computation resources. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the complex nature of diabetes and highlights the potential of advanced analytics in improving patient outcomes.

The objective of this research is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the onset of diabetes based on various physiological and demographic factors.The dependent variable (Y) is the presence or absence of diabetes, and the independent variables (X) include age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and other biochemical markers (from s1 to s6, including glucose, obesity and other diabetes related factors).This research will use a decision tree algorithm to test our hypothesis, as it is a simple yet powerful method for classification tasks and can handle both numerical and categorical data.This research will use multiple evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC).
